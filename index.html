                        <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve 
                        <br> my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing 
                        <br> some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell 
                        <br> phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more 
                        <br> sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) 
                        <br> made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that 
                        <br> the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work 
                            <br> thatâ€™s not finished or doesnâ€™t look perfect. You will

                   finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your
